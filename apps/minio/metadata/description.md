# Minio - Open Source Object Storage

Host your own Amazon S3 compatible Object Storage!

## Installation Info

This MinIO setup requires two exposed URLS

- The console URL
- The S3 API URL

While the console URL is defined by the runtipi's default expose URL you need to define the S3 API URL in the settings when installing.

**Example:**

- API: Minio S3 API URL: s3.mydomain.com
- Console: Exposed URL: minio.mydomain.com

| Exposed Service     | Local Port | Exposed Domain     |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Minio API           | IP:8000    | s3.mydomain.com    |
