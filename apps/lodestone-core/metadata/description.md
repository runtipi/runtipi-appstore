### Safety & Security

Lodestone Core is written entirely in safe Rust, and uses`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. However **we can't guarantee the safety of the crates and binaries we link to**, as those may use unsafe rust.

Lodestone is created with security as a top priority. While most of the safety critical code such as login and permissions management have been tested thoroughly, **no formal security audit has been done for any part of Lodestone.**
