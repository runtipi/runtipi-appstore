Without active preservation effort, everything on the internet eventually dissapears or degrades. Archive.org does a great job as a centralized service, but saved URLs have to be public, and they can't save every type of content.

ArchiveBox is an open source tool that lets organizations & individuals archive both public & private web content while retaining control over their data. It can be used to save copies of bookmarks, preserve evidence for legal cases, backup photos from FB/Insta/Flickr or media from YT/Soundcloud/etc., save research papers, and more...

📥 **You can feed ArchiveBox URLs one at a time, or schedule regular imports** from your bookmarks or history, social media feeds or RSS, link-saving services like Pocket/Pinboard, our [Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/archivebox-exporter/habonpimjphpdnmcfkaockjnffodikoj), and more.  

**It saves snapshots of the URLs you feed it in several redundant formats.**  
It also detects any content featured *inside* pages & extracts it out into a folder:

- 🌐 **HTML**/**Any websites** ➡️ `original HTML+CSS+JS`, `singlefile HTML`, `screenshot PNG`, `PDF`, `WARC`, `title`, `article text`, `favicon`, `headers`, ...
- 🎥 **Social Media**/**News** ➡️ `post content TXT`, `comments`, `title`, `author`, `images`, ...
- 🎬 **YouTube**/**SoundCloud**/etc. ➡️ `MP3/MP4`s, `subtitles`, `metadata`, `thumbnail`, ...
- 💾 **Github**/**Gitlab**/etc. links ➡️ `clone of GIT source code`, `README`, `images`, ...
- ✨ *and more ...
