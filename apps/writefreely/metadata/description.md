# WriteFreely
WriteFreely is a clean, minimalist publishing platform made for writers. Start a blog, share knowledge within your organization, or build a community around the shared act of writing.

## Admin Creation

You will likely want to create an admin account after installation. You can do
that by using the container's terminal to run the following command:

```bash
writefreely -c /mnt/config/etc/writefreely.ini --create-admin [username]:[password]
```

This will create your initial admin user account.

### Features

#### Made for writing

Built on a plain, auto-saving editor, WriteFreely gives you a distraction-free writing environment. Once published, your words are front and center, and easy to read.

#### A connected community

Start writing together, publicly or privately. Connect with other communities, whether running WriteFreely, Plume, or other ActivityPub-powered software. And bring members on board from your existing platforms, thanks to our OAuth 2.0 support.

#### Intuitive organization

Categorize articles with hashtags, and create static pages from normal posts by pinning them to your blog. Create draft posts and publish to multiple blogs from one account.

#### International

Blog elements are localized in 20+ languages, and WriteFreely includes first-class support for non-Latin and right-to-left (RTL) script languages.

#### Private by default

WriteFreely collects minimal data, and never publicizes more than a writer consents to. Writers can seamlessly create multiple blogs from a single account for different pen names or purposes without publicly revealing their association.
