A modern client-server application for the [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/) file-sharing network.

## Features

### Secure access

slskd runs as a daemon or Docker container in your network (or in the cloud!) and is accessible from a web browser.  It's designed to be exposed to the internet, and everything is secured with a token that [you can control](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/blob/master/docs/config.md#authentication).  It also supports [reverse proxies](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/blob/master/docs/reverse_proxy.md), making it work well with other self-hosted tools.

### Search

Search for things just like you're used to with the official Soulseek client.  slskd makes it easy to enter multiple searches quickly.

### Results

Sort and filter search results using the same filters you use today.  Dismiss results you're not interested in, and download the ones you want in a couple of clicks.

### Downloads

Monitor the speed and status of downloads, grouped by user and folder.  Click the progress bar to fetch your place in queue, and use the selection tools to cancel, retry, or clear completed downloads.  Use the controls at the top to quickly manage downloads by status.

### Pretty much everything else

slskd can do almost everything the official Soulseek client can; browse user shares, join chat rooms, privately chat with other users.

New features are added all the time!
