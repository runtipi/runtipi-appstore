## Semaphore UI (formerly Ansible Semaphore)

Semaphore is a modern UI for Ansible, Terraform/OpenTofu, Bash and Pulumi. It lets you easily run Ansible playbooks, get notifications about fails, control access to deployment system.

If your project has grown and deploying from the terminal is no longer for you then Semaphore UI is what you need.

> Note 📝: If you want to use a path for repository in semaphore you can add your own repo in `runtipi/app-data/semaphore/data/repositories` and in semaphore use `/repositories/myrepo`
