[teddit.net](https://teddit.net)

A free and open source alternative Reddit front-end focused on privacy.
Inspired by the [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) project.

* No JavaScript or ads
* All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Reddit
* Prevents Reddit from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
* [Unofficial API](https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit/wiki#teddit-api) (RSS & JSON support, no rate limits or Reddit account required)
* Lightweight (teddit frontpage: ~30 HTTP requests with ~270 KB of data downloaded vs. Reddit frontpage: ~190 requests with ~24 MB)
* Self-hostable. Anyone can setup an instance. An instance can either use Reddit's API with or without OAuth (so Reddit API key is not necessarily needed).
