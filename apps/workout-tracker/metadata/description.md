## API usage

The API is documented using
[swagger](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jovandeginste/workout-tracker/master/docs/swagger.yaml).
You must enable API access for your user, and copy the API key. You can use the
API key as a query parameter (`api-key=${API_KEY}`) or as a header
(`Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}`).

You can configure some tools to automatically upload files to Workout Tracker,
using the `POST /api/v1/import/$program` API endpoint.

### Generic upload

The generic upload endpoint takes the recording as body. Prepend the path with
`@` to tell `curl` to read the data from a file:

```bash
curl -sSL -H "Authorization: bearer your-api-key" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/import/generic \
  --data @path/to/recorded.gpx
```

or

```bash
curl -sSL http://localhost:8080/api/v1/import/generic?api-key=your-api-key \
  --data @path/to/recorded.gpx
```

### FitoTrack

Read [their documentation](https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack/wiki/Auto-Export) before you continue.

The path to POST to is: `/api/v1/import/fitotrack?api-key=${API_KEY}`

## Compatiblity

This is a work in progress. If you find any problems, please let us know. The
application is tested with GPX files from these sources:

- Garmin Connect (export to GPX)
- FitoTrack (automatic export to GPX)
- Workoutdoors (export to GPX)
