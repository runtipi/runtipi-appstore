  "description": "Spoolman is a web service that helps you keep track of your filament spools and how they are being used. It acts as a database, where other printer software such as Octoprint and Moonraker can interact with to have a centralized place for spool information. For example, if used together with Moonraker, your spool weight will automatically be reduced as your print is progressing.",
