## [](https://github.com/JulianPrieber/littlelink-custom#function)Function

**LittleLink Custom offers** a unique solution for managing and sharing links online. Our platform provides **a website similar to** [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), allowing users to **overcome the limitation of only being able to add one link on social media platforms**. By **linking to your LittleLink Custom page**, users can easily **access all the links they need** in one convenient location.

Our platform allows users to **host their links on their own web-server or web-hosting provider**, ensuring easy accessibility and control over their online presence. Additionally, **other users can register and create their own links**, making it an ideal solution for businesses and organizations looking to manage multiple links.

Our platform also includes an **Admin Panel**, enabling users to easily **access other user's links**, making it an ideal solution for businesses and organizations looking to manage multiple links. Overall, LittleLink Custom provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for streamlining online presence.

## [](https://github.com/JulianPrieber/littlelink-custom#about)About

**LittleLink Custom** is a fork of [LittleLink Admin](https://github.com/latuminggi/littlelink-admin) with a **set goal** of making the admin panel **easier to use and setup** for inexperienced and first-time users, with the addition of **many custom features** themed around customization for the individual users' LittleLink pages.

**LittleLink Custom** was developed to simplify the usage and setup of LittleLink and LittleLink Admin for individuals who have minimal coding experience or limited knowledge of web hosting. This project is designed in a way that allows for **drag and drop** implementation of the LittleLink Custom **directory onto** your web host's **root directory**, eliminating the need for source code manipulation or dealing with complex terminal commands.

In addition to a user-friendly setup process, this fork offers **numerous custom features** that enhance the user experience, including a **dark mode** that automatically applies based on your operating system's or browser theme settings, and light unobtrusive **CSS animations** for an aesthetically pleasing **responsive design**. These and other small changes, when combined, provide a substantial feature set that **differentiates LittleLink Custom from other forks**.

- Click on “Update automatically” and the updater will take care of the rest.

You can still download updates manually. New versions will are still uploaded to the GitHub repository as usual.

If you switched your database to MySQL, your database will not be included in the backup.

LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate—we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services."
