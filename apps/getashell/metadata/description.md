## Get A Shell üêö

**Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è:** If you are updating to version 1.0.0 make sure to set a username and a password in the settings menu. 

Have you ever wanted to just spin up a quick server than you can ssh into to test something real quick? Well with get a shell
you can just spin up the ui select a distro and click _Get me a shell!_ and üí• you have an ssh server with your specified distro. No need to spin up vms, run commands or anything harder than a click!

> Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: The app is in early stages of development, I am still quite new to both writing full stack apps and using technologies like drizzle and react. Any contributions are welcome.
