picture on blank canvas. We provide enough guard rails to make data entry easy and error free. The
editor comes with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error checking and auto formatting.

### Privacy

Selling your data is not the indirect goal of the app. The app will never collect or send any data
to any server. All your data is stored in your system. Check out the manifesto for more details.

### Price Tracking

Paisa supports various price data providers, so it can keep track of the latest price of all your
assets. It also allows the user to enter the price manually, so you can use it to revalue your
assets like house, car, land, etc.

### Budget and Expenses

Paisa allows you to track your expenses at the granularity of your choice. You can customize the
categories and subcategories to suit your needs, even the icon is customizable. If you are tight on
money, don't worry, paisa got you covered. You can set a budget for each category and make sure you
don't overspend.

### Data Import

You don't have to sit and manually enter all your transactions. You can get the account statements
from your bank or credit card provider and import them into paisa. Paisa import system is flexible
enough to handle most of the formats out there in the wild. Once you set up the import template, it
will hardly take 5 minutes to import and categorize all your transactions each month.

### Sheets

Ever wanted to calculate your taxes, emis, etc.? Paisa comes with a notepad calculator called sheet
that can do all the calculations with the data from your ledger. The sheets are live and
interactive, and will update automatically when you change the data in your ledger.

### Goals

Want to know how much you need to save for your next vacation? or how long it will take to buy a new
car? Paisa can help you with planning and tracking your goals. If you know how much you can afford
to save each month, paisa can tell you when you can achieve your goal. On the other hand, if you
have a deadline, paisa can tell you how much you need to save each month to achieve your goal.

### Bills

Paisa can help you track your recurring transactions like rent, emi, credit card bills, etc. The
calendar view will show you all the bills that are due in the current month. You can set the
recurring period of the transaction, which is flexible enough to handle any kind of schedule like
weekly, monthly, quarterly, last day of the month, last day of the quarter, etc.
